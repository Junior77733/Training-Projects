# Training-Projects

Most recent project:
Food Website - Training Project
  -  Has hyperlinks
  -  Button interactivity

Slider project is about having auto sliders (manually controllable as well) in a website, good for a character select screen (pfft)

react-movie is an app made using React.js, it uses moviedb.org's API to integrate images and movie titles, to open it in VS Code (or your
command palette)
for example:
  open up a terminal,
  change the directory to the 'movie-project' if it's not already changed,
  use 'cd "path > movie-project" (for example: cd "C:Users/Path/Path/react-movie>movie-project")
  then run 'npm run build' which will give you host link, open it in a browser.

  Apologies for the inconvenience but I'm planning on making this into an executable file so that no has to go through this
  annoyance.

  Thanks!
