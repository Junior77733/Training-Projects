                        We've all been there: It's a swelteringly hot day and you've been sweating like a dog, so when it comes to mealtime, you instinctively reach for the obvious.
                        <br>

A steaming hot bowl of soup.
<br>
If that scenario seems bizarre to you, think again: Around the world, the natural thing to do when it's hot out is to eat something hot (as in temperature, though a little spicy heat doesn't hurt either).

<br>

In Vietnam, it's a bowl of pho. On the Korean Peninsula, the cure for heat is any number of piping hot broths. In Mexico, hot and spicy dishes like tamales are the answer to hunger pangs even if there's a blazing sun outside. And in China, "refreshing" means a cup of hot water.<br>

To an American, even a well-traveled one with a daring palate, it can all seem ... odd. <br>

"What sticks out to me is the insistence, in many corners of Asia, on drinking very hot water whatever the weather," says Matt Gross, former Bon Appetit editor, New York Times Frugal Traveler, and consultant for the Apple+ series Omnivore. "It’s done for historical and health reasons, and I kind of love it in the winter, when the heat gives [the water] a sweetness, but when summer temps hit the 90s I can’t quite handle it."<br>

<br>

Clinical psychologist and registered dietitian Supatra Tovar says that there are both psychological and physiological reasons why eating hot foods in the summer can make sense.

"Psychologically, cultural norms and traditions play a significant role," she says. "People may associate certain foods with comfort and familiarity, and these foods often transcend seasonal variations."

In other words, the mind can be a more powerful force than even the sun—and you might see evidence of that in the Chinese insistence on drinking hot water even on the hottest days.

In traditional Chinese medicine, maintaining a balance of yin and yang is considered key to keeping healthy. In particular, yang, associated with "hot" energy, is seen as critical to properly functioning internal organs, and hot water is seen as an important way to maintain that internal energy balance. That was reinforced in the 1930s, when the Nationalist government of China rolled out nationwide health campaigns that encouraged people to drink warm water, which was believed to be cleaner, instead of cold water. The communist government repeated this message with its own public health campaigns in the 1950s. These educational efforts were so successful that boiling water is a given almost anywhere you can find a water dispenser in China even today, as the idea that hot water's the healthy option has become internalized over generations of Chinese.

The general idea is the same in places like South Korea, where age-old sayings encourage people to fight the heat by eating hot foods, and basically anywhere else where it's considered normal. If a belief has been ingrained in a person by their culture from birth, then you're not going to shake it out of them just by pointing at a thermometer and giving them a disbelieving look like they just told you the Earth is flat. (It's not, for the record.) </p>
